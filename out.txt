Okay, the user asked for the current time twice. I need to use the get_time function once to provide the information. Let me check the function parameters. It doesn't require any arguments, so I'll call get_time with the current time. Then, I'll state the result. Wait, but the observation already has the time. Maybe I should just confirm the time once. Let me make sure there's no need for multiple tool calls. The user's question is straightforward, so one tool call should suffice. Alright, let's proceed.

The current time is 21:29:42.
