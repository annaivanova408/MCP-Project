Okay, the user asked for the current time twice, and I used the get_time tool once. The result came back as "Sat Jun 14 19:07:42 2025". Now I need to present this information clearly. Let me make sure to format it correctly in the answer. The user might want the time in a specific format, but since the tool's response already includes the time, I can directly state it. No need to call any other functions here. Just confirm the time and deliver it.
