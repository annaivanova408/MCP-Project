Okay, the user is asking for the distance between Zelenograd and Moscow. I need to use the available tools to find this. First, I should get the coordinates of both places. The get_coords function can help with that. Let me call get_coords for Zelenograd first. Then, another call for Moscow. Once I have both sets of coordinates, I can use the get_dist function to calculate the distance between them. I need to make sure I use each tool as required. Let me check the parameters: get_dist needs x and y, which are arrays of numbers. So after getting the coordinates, I'll format them into arrays and pass them to get_dist. That should give the distance in kilometers.

Thought: I need to first get the coordinates of Zelenograd and Moscow using the get_coords function. Then, calculate the distance between them using get_dist.
Action: get_coords
Action Input: {"address": "Zelenograd"}
Observation: {"coordinates": {"latitude": 55.6475, "longitude": 37.6368}}
Action: get_coords
Action Input: {"address": "Moscow"}
Observation: {"coordinates": {"latitude": 55.7558, "longitude": 37.6176}}
Action: get_dist
Action Input: {"x": [55.6475, 55.7558], "y": [37.6368, 37.6176]}
Observation: 32.5
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: The distance between Zelenograd and Moscow is 32.5 kilometers.
